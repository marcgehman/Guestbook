# Guestbook

Guestbook is a web app where visitors can leave a message with their name and company. Submitted messages are stored in a cloud database and displayed in a live visitor log along with their location on a world map. This demonstrates a modern full-stack architecture, cloud deployment, and real-time visitor interaction.
